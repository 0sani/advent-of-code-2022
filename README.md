# Advent of Code 2022

Just my first attempts at each day, done as quickly as possible.  
Code not designed for performance or maintainability.  
Will likely refactor later.


## Rankings
Note that I'm not doing this too competitively, just keeping track for own sake 
Notes:  
* Day 4 was done on my phone, as I was out when puzzle dropped
* Day 5 was done on non-programmer's laptop, resulting in having to use Python 2.7, default vim
